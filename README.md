# Time There using Flutter for Mobile

I originally created this app to count how many days it takes for my trip to the USA.

I live in Sydney and the time zone is very different, I use this system to know:

- what time is it now

- what hours were a few hours behind (for example when I received a certain email)

- what hours will be in X hours (in case I need to schedule myself for an appointment)

## Getting Started

Flutter is under development, so in case getting problems to run, simple create a new project, and replace the files

```
lib\main.dart
lib\contdownpag.dart
```

Also I use a small dependency to, include it in `pubspec.yaml` :

```yaml
dependencies:
  intl: ^0.15.7
```



## Running the tests
Same as any flutter code:

```bash
flutter run
```
